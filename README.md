A clean, lightweight .NET 9 SDK for working with the PRTG Network Monitor API.

## Features

- üîê Auth via PRTG API token
- üì° Fetch devices and sensors
- üß† Sensor classification and formatting
- üö¶ Handles pagination and throttling
- ü™∂ Minimal dependencies, logging via `ILogger<T>`

## Security & Auth Notes

This SDK uses **PRTG API v1**, which authenticates via API token passed in the query string.

- ‚úÖ Best used with a **dedicated, read-only PRTG user** account.
- üîê Ensure HTTPS is enabled on your PRTG server.
- üö´ Do not log full request URLs ‚Äî the SDK redacts API tokens in debug logs.
- ‚è±Ô∏è All HTTP requests enforce a timeout and avoid blocking indefinitely.

For session-based auth with bearer tokens (API v2), use a different integration ‚Äî this SDK is intentionally optimized for unattended, background service use.

## Installation

This SDK is designed for internal use but may be published to NuGet in the future.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "PRTG": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://prtg.example.com",
    "ApiToken": "your_token_here"
  }
}
```

You may also call `.Validate()` on `PrtgOptions` to ensure required fields are set and well-formed.

Bind this config using:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<PrtgOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("PRTG"));
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<PrtgService>();
```

## Usage

```csharp
var devices = await prtgService.GetAllDevicesWithGroupsAsync();
var sensors = await prtgService.GetSensorsByDeviceIdAsync(device.ObjectId);
```

## Logging

All operations use `ILogger<T>`:
- `Debug` level for API calls, pagination, counts
- `Warning` for non-success responses

If logging full sensor or device payloads, use `.SanitizeForLog()` to redact diagnostic fields like `Message`, `Status`, or names.
